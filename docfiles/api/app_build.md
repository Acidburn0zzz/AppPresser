Title: Building Your App for the App Stores

# Building your App

Your app doesn't do much until you package it to work on a device.

To purchase an app build from us, select the build service from our products page and checkout. You will be sent more instructions after purchasing.

You will need a developer license for the platforms you wish to build for. For iOS, you will need to generate a certificate and provisioning profile from https://developer.apple.com and send that to us prior to building your app.

We will build your app and send you the binary file that you can upload to itunes connect.

## DIY Building

You can build the app yourself using Phonegap if you wish.

The easiest way is to create an account at https://build.phonegap.com, and follow their instructions.  You can also build the app locally using the Phonegap CLI, but this is more of a manual process.  You can find more information on building locally here: http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.1.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface

#Submitting your App to iTunes Connect

Visit http://itunesconnect.apple.com, and login with your main developer account.

Click "Manage your apps", then click add new app. Fill out all of the requested information. Be descriptive and concise, and make sure to include at least one screenshot.

Here are the [PhoneGap project files](http://apppresser.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/apppresser-pg.zip) so you can see what all goes on with this part of the process.
