# Welcome to AppPresser

Thank you for your interest in building with AppPresser. We hope you enjoy your time with our suite of tools and build awesome applications with it, all on top of the ever-familiar WordPress CMS.

## What is AppPresser

AppPresser is a suite of tools that will help you build applications, ready for smartphone App stores. AppPresser is more than just a mobile theme, it bridges your WordPress site with your smartphone and integrates itself with the smartphone hardware like the camera, geolocation, and more.

Once you have completed your application and it is release ready, you can publish the application to Apple's iOS App Store, Google Play, and others. People all over the world will have instant access to purchase or download your work.


## Won't I need to learn a completely new skillset for that?

If you're already familiar with making a WordPress website, you're already most of the way there. You won't be needing to learn languages or toolkits like Objective C, Java, or SDK. Just build like you always have.

Once you're ready, you will use provided plugins and theme starting point to make WordPress look and behave like a native app. You'll get sliding panels, menus, and ability to tap into device hardware.

Ready to sell your app in the app stores? Let us help you by packaging up the app so that you can submit it to the stores. Want to just use it on the web? That's ok too. The App store submission is not a requirement.
