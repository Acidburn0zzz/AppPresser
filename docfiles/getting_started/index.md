# Getting Started

## Installing AppPresser core plugin.

Before you can get started working on your AppPresser powered WordPress website, you will need to at least have the [AppPresser core plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/apppresser/). You can get that from the wordpress.org plugin repository free of charge. You can download the plugin from the wordpress.org page itself, or you can install it from within your WordPress admin panel by searching for "AppPresser" on your "Add New Plugin" page. Activate as you regularly would any other plugin, and visit the AppPresser Settings page, once done, to start configuring the plugin.

Visit [installing and configuring the core plugin](./installing_apppresser_core/) for more details on configuring the core plugin.

## Installing AppPresser extensions

While it's possible that you'll only need the core plugin to achieve what you need for your AppPresser powered application, chances are you'll want to extend it to have more features, without having to code that all yourself. We have you covered. If you visit the [AppPresser Extensions Store](../../extensions/), you'll be able to purchase and download extra extensions for your application.

Starting out we have three different extensions, and one theme to help get you started. The three extensions we have are, [AppSwiper](../extensions/appswiper/), [AppCamera](../extensions/appcamera/), [AppWoo](../extensions/appwoo/) and the available theme is [AppTheme](../extensions/apptheme/).

As you install and activate more extensions, tabs will be added to the AppPresser settings page. Selecting the exension's tab that you want to configure will allow you to choose options and save them.

Find out more about each extension by visiting their documentation pages, or more about our [extensions](../extensions/) for more general information.
