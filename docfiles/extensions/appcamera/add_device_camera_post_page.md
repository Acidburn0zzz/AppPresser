# How to add device camera to a post or page

In this tutorial, we will walk you through how to add the user's device camera to a post or a page for your AppPresser install.

## Adding AppPresser camera to a post or page

Next up, we need to add the AppPresser Camera to a post or page of your choosing. To do that, we're going to use the handy `[ap-camera]` shortcode. Once you have selected with post or page you want to add this to, click to edit the page and add `[ap-camera]` to the post editor.

After you have pasted in the shortcode and configured any [shortcode attributes]() you want for it, click the "Publish" button if it's a new post or page. Click the "Update" button if updating an already created post or page.
